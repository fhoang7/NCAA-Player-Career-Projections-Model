    "The next step is to start binning our data. The goal for binning was to have some reason behind the size of our bins. This was accomplished by creating the functions below. The python package jenks bins the data in different sizes and then we found the variance fit for each of the sizes of bins and selected the bin that had a variance fit of 0.9. This was to not over fit our binning. We ran these functions across all of our features to select the correct bin size for all of them. \n",
